Hi, my name's Maggie. 

I'm currently living in NYC and playing at <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>. I fall prey to too many interests, but I enjoy writing software, reading science fiction, and I spend a good bit of time on a bicycle or cooking.

The title of this blog is an intentional nod at Karatani's <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/architecture-metaphor">Architecture as Metaphor</a>.

Get in touch! You can email me at emmbeezee at gmail. I'm on twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zmagg/">@zmagg</a>.

Here are some <a href="http://zmagg.com/coffee/">coffee recs</a>.
